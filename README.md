![Quantum Cryptography](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/QKD_Schematic.png)

## Overview
Quantum Password Authenticator is a security system leveraging quantum cryptography principles to enhance authentication security. This project utilizes quantum key distribution (QKD) techniques to ensure safe and unbreakable password exchanges, making it resistant to brute-force attacks and classical hacking methods.

## Features
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** for secure password exchanges
- **Unbreakable encryption** using quantum-based security principles
- **Resistant to eavesdropping** through quantum superposition and entanglement
- **Integration with traditional authentication systems**
- **Scalable implementation** for various security applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Quantum Cryptography Algorithms
- NumPy & SciPy
- Open Quantum Safe (OQS) Libraries
- Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 Protocol)

## Installation
To set up and run the Quantum Password Authenticator on your system:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AhanaSrinivas/Quantum-Password-Authenticator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Quantum-Password-Authenticator
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. The system generates a quantum key using the **BB84 Protocol**.
2. The key is distributed securely, preventing any third-party interception.
3. The user authentication process encrypts and transmits the password using the quantum key.
4. The system verifies the authenticity of the user by matching decrypted credentials.

## Use Cases
- **High-security authentication** for banking, government, and corporate applications.
- **Secure communications** in sensitive environments.
- **Enhancing existing password systems** with quantum cryptography.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing more quantum-safe cryptographic methods.
- Improving efficiency and speed of key exchanges.
- Extending support for multiple authentication factors.
